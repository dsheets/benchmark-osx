# OS X Application System Functionality Benchmarks

This repository contains collections of benchmarks for common system
functionality that applications use. Benchmarks in Swift, Go, C, and
OCaml are included. Where possible, we attempt to perform the same basic
operation in as many different common ways as possible. If asynchronous
programming techniques are common in a community, we include benchmarks
covering the system functionality as accessed via those techniques.

Benchmark suites include:

 - [readdir](readdir): directory listings
